🙌 2. Project Description

## 🎓 A Farewell Tribute to Our Mentor - Nikhil Dada 💙

This fun and heartfelt C program is dedicated to our programming mentor **Nikhil Dada**, who didn’t just teach us code — he showed us how to dream, lead, and grow!

It simulates a terminal-based tribute using slow typewriter animation to bring back the best flashbacks of our journey together at **GCOEY**.
